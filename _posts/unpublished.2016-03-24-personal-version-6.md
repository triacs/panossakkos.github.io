It's been about half a year since <a href="https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme" target="blank">{ Personal }</a> was open-sourced. Since then it attracted
some attention, which organically made it more mature, stable and improved it with
new handy features. Currently the repository counts 12 <a href="https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md" target="blank">contributors</a>! :clap:

The mission of { Personal } is to make the web more beautiful, quick and secure, and version 6.0.0
is on the right track :smile: 

The new version contains bug fixes and the following features
